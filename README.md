# Password-Generator

## Description

This is a fully functional password generator.  It is fully responsive to screen size.  I believe I have it free from breaking.  It includes a password length, but can be easily changed.  It has a few options on what the password can include.  And reset button.  The point of this exercise was to learn about javascript, logic, and DOM.  

I felt very comfortable writing this.  It went much faster than previous exercises, not just the initial coding, but when I wanted to change things for aesthetic reasons or troubleshoot something that wasn't working right.  This all felt good.  I would like to make this easier to use by avoiding prompts, alerts, and confirms and using a form with check marks, but that is for another time.

## The rest

Feel free to use this on any size page; it should accommodate and look pretty similar everywhere it can be seen.  Anyone is free to use this in anyway they choose, but try to refrain from cheating.
